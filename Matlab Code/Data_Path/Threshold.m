%createMask  Threshold RGB image using auto-generated code from colorThresholder app.
%  [BW,MASKEDRGBIMAGE] = createMask(RGB) thresholds image RGB using
%  auto-generated code from the colorThresholder App. The colorspace and
%  minimum/maximum values for each channel of the colorspace were set in the
%  App and result in a binary mask BW and a composite image maskedRGBImage,
%  which shows the original RGB image values under the mask BW.
